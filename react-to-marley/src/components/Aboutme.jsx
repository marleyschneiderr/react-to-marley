            Marley here ðŸ¤Ÿ. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in training. I'm just a few weeks away from completing my bootcamp, and I can't wait to get started in the tech industry. I graduated from Washington State University in May 2022 with a BA in Advertising and a BA in Digital Technology and Culture. I am currently employed as a Customer Solutions Representative at ChemPoint in Bellevue, Washington. I am eager to begin my career in development . My primary focus right now is on developing a variety of projects to demonstrate my bootcamp learnings. I enjoy developing react and node.js applications and look forward to creating passion projects that I am proud of.
